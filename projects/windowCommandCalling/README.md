# windowCommandCalling

Invoke a command from a form window, and view the result in a grid window and/or console.

The idea behind this script is to make it a bit simpler to use PowerShell commands for people who're unfamiliar with the syntax and/or working with CLI tools, and for the result do also be displayed in a more visual manner, but at the same time allow the result to be used within a scripting context (setting variables, piping objects, etc.).
