# Loop bat

A wrapper around [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), which continuously reads the contents of the specified file at a set interval (defaults to every second).

This script cleanly clears the console and then writes the bat output in one go, in order to avoid blinking text in the console

Use <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> to exit.
