# slidePuzzle

![A slide puzzle.](./githubAssets/example.png)

A simple console-based slide puzzle game.

The goal is to slide all pieces into their correct places, and end with the empty tile in the bottom-right corner.

Use the arrow keys to move the puzzle pieces around.

The dimensions of the puzzle, the number of pre-game shuffles, and color highlights, are all toggleable via parameters.
